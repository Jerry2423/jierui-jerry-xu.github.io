# Project Image Placeholders

The website references several project images that need to be created:

## Required Images for Projects:

### LLM Acceleration Project:
- `llm_accel_before.jpg` (160x160px) - Before image for LLM acceleration project hover effect
- `llm_accel_after.jpg` (160x160px) - After image for LLM acceleration project hover effect

### Hardware Co-design Project:
- `hw_codesign_before.jpg` (160x160px) - Before image for hardware co-design project hover effect  
- `hw_codesign_after.jpg` (160x160px) - After image for hardware co-design project hover effect

### Other Projects:
- `distributed_llm.jpg` (160x160px) - Image for distributed LLM training project
- `tensorrt_opt.jpg` (160x160px) - Image for TensorRT optimization project

### Profile Photo:
- `profile.jpg` (400x400px recommended) - Your professional profile photo

## Image Guidelines:
- Use relevant screenshots, diagrams, or visualizations from your projects
- Keep consistent 160x160px sizing for project thumbnails
- Profile photo should be professional and well-lit
- Consider using diagrams or flowcharts to represent technical concepts

## Temporary Solution:
Until you add actual images, the website may show broken image icons. Consider creating simple placeholder images with project names or using generic technical graphics.
