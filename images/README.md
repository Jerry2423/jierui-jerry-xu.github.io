## Interactive Image Effects

Some projects use hover effects with "before" and "after" images:
- The "before" image is shown by default
- The "after" image appears when hovering over the project
- This creates an engaging interactive experience

## Image Guidelines
- Profile photo should be professional and high-quality
- Publication/project images should be 160x160 pixels for consistency
- Use JPG format for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency
- Keep file sizes reasonable for web loading
- For interactive projects, create both "before" and "after" versions

## Favicon
The `favicon/` directory contains the website icon files. Replace these with your own branding if desired.
